# PlaneTalk ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-Swift-green)

PlaneTalk is an iOS app written in Swift which lets you send messages to other devices connected to the same Wi-fi-Hotspot network.
It's suitable in places where there is no internet connection like airplanes (hence the name PlaneTalk ðŸ˜ƒ).

The core functionalities are all built around some TCP and UDP's `syscall` and uses `kevent` as event notification system.
The UDP protocol is only being used for discovery's purposes whereas the TCP protocol is being used to connect and communicate with the server.

## How it works
When a device launches the app, it can choose to become either the server or a client.

The server is listening to UDP messages to detect clients in the network and opens a TCP socket to receive connection's requests.
Clients instead, will broadcast UDP messages for discovery purposes.
Once the server receives a discovery message, it broadcasts a discovery response message and then the client then connects to the server via TCP.
